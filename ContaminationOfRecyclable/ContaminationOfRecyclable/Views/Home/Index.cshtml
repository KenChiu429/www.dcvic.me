                E-waste can contaminate bins and landfills in several ways:

                The Victorian Government has banned e-waste from landfill in Victoria, effective 1 July 2019. E-waste is growing up to three times faster than general municipal waste in Australia. This ban helps to address the risks and opportunities associated with this rapid rate of growth.

            <li class="list-group-item">Soft plastics, such as plastic bags, food packaging, and cling wrap, can contaminate the recycling bin in Victoria, Australia if they are not disposed of properly. Soft plastics cannot be recycled in the same way as hard plastics, as they have a different chemical composition and can clog up recycling machinery. According to the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, soft plastics account for approximately 20% of the plastic packaging used in Australia, but only 3% are recycled. </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">If soft plastics are placed in the recycling bin, they can cause contamination of other materials, such as paper and cardboard, which reduces the quality of the recycled material and can make it difficult to recycle. Soft plastics can also pose a risk to workers in the recycling facility, as they can get caught in machinery and cause blockages. </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Unfortunately, the REDcycle program which allows for the collection and recycling of soft plastics by providing dedicated bins at participating supermarkets was suspended. Therefore, under recent recycling policy in Victoria, all soft plastic is going to landfill bin. Victoria Government must find another proper way to dispose soft plastic.  </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">It is important to note that not all soft plastics can be recycled, and it is important to check the guidelines of your local recycling program or drop-off location to see which types of soft plastics are accepted. It is also important to ensure that soft plastics are clean and dry before they are placed in the recycling bin or dropped off for recycling.   </li>

            <li class="list-group-item">Construction waste can contaminate the waste stream in several ways. First, construction waste is often bulky and heavy, which can cause problems for waste management infrastructure. For example, construction waste can overload garbage trucks and other waste collection vehicles, making it more difficult and expensive to transport and dispose of waste. Overloading can also damage collection vehicles and can lead to accidents and safety issues for workers.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Second, construction waste can contain hazardous materials that pose a risk to public health and the environment. For example, construction waste may contain asbestos, lead, and other hazardous materials that can leach into the soil and groundwater if not properly disposed of. These hazardous materials can also pose a risk to waste management workers if they come into contact with them. </li>
            <li class="list-group-item">Third, construction waste can contaminate the recycling stream if not properly sorted and disposed of. Many construction materials, such as concrete, bricks, and wood, can be recycled or repurposed if they are separated from other waste streams. However, if construction waste is mixed in with other waste streams, it can make it more difficult and expensive to separate and recycle these materials. </li>
